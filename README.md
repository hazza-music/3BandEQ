# 3BandEQ
This repo contains all the files for my designed 3 band filter. Included is a MATLAB application and my final technical report

## Loading the App
To edit the app, load MATLAB first and then open the .app file. <br>
To install the app, load the app installer.

## Loading the script
The script has a few dependent functions. To load and run the script, please open EqMain and run from there. <br>

## Music
I have given three smaller clipped tracks to act as examples to be loaded. Please note this is for educational use and I do not own the rights to All of Me by Ella Fitzgerald or Disco Uylsses by Vulfpeck. The Lo-Fi demo is mine :).
